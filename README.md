Hi! Iâ€™m John. Iâ€™m currently working as Head of Engineering at [Sthima](https://github.com/sthima) and I lead the mobile team which is composed of 15 developers. Iâ€™ve been working on the development of multiples systems for the most various areas, such as: Sports, Security, FinTechs, Wellbeing, Tracking cargo, Streaming, etc. Although Iâ€™ve worked on more than 50 digital products, in the last years I chose to focus on mobile development. Currently, the stacks that I work with are: React, React-Native, Typescript, Ionic, Node, Nestjs, GCP, AWS, Circleci. In recent years, my team and I have helped companies abroad to create amazing applications, optimizing their work and their relationship with clients. If you have an idea or you are looking for a professional team to build and develop your app, Iâ€™m sure that we can help you achieve your goals. Feel free to contact me to talk about your ideias :).
